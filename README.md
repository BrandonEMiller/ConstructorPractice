ConstructorPractice
===================

Some practice working with basic constructors

This was my first exposure to constructors while at The Iron Yard Academy.  

This application does not do anything on the page, rather it creates constructors to be called in the console. 

This was also used as more practice for the class to work on Test Driven Development and was great practice for writing unit tests.
